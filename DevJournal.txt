I created all of my character files that I spent several weeks on. I recently learned how to use eclipse, and during that time I created several files that are not useful to the project, so I apologize if some random files appear on the GitHub screen. I watched several tutorials online as to how to make a 2D plat former, so I was able to make a constructor and import tons of java things that I created, such as a character appearance and backgrounds. I also created my “main” method for my project, which is currently not very large, but seems to compile and has a substantial amount of variables. I also set the frame rate for the project, which I believe is 120fps in a standard window. Currently I am having a problem with my project because I accidentally copied several files that I didn’t need to, so I will spend this weekend updating the GitHub project webpage with my current files.
