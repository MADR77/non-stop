This is the page that you answer the question being asked in the other text document!

1). Yes. Well sorta. They should be in one of the 16x16 tile maps I already have spread throughout the dropbox.
2). If you stole/borrowed/took these from the internet we can not use them. This applies to all other textures you may have added to the dropbox.
(The examples are roalty free, but were copyed from the interwebs, but... the ones in the sprite sheet i made)

Wait seriously? You actually made all of those...? (Besides the royalty free ones of course.)
We will probably end up using some of the player textures, maybe some of the tile textures.
Would you like to come over to Chad's house? (Say yes say yes 'cause I need to know~)

3). Well those character sprites are already 32x32 and they will work fine. We're probably going to use the top middle guy for the main character.
4). I am at Chad's house. Thank you for asking. When does your soccer thingy end?

6). That one looks fabulous. (Almost better than the original (Me gusta (Brackets are fun (thebomb.com))))
6.1). Did you become a master pixel artist over night? (Don't answer that) 
6.2). We will need the other 11 frames of him as well.

7.) (No(,(I(Was(trying(to(copy(the(other(one(in(my(own(creative(style(.))))))))))))))))
 (Sorry for answering that)

You spelled brakets wrong!
It should be spelled: brackets
You spelled parenthesis wrong!
It should be spelled: paraentheses

(I spelt parenthesis correctly) and brackets)
(Paraentheses is the plural noun of parenthesis)

Does my soccer thingy get over to late for your likeing?

You never told me what time it gets over... 

oh... I get done at 8:00pm Mountian Time

Mountain*

...wha???

back on topic

That may or may not be too late.

You may create a(some) level(s). I need the tiles spritesheet to be completed before I'm adding any tiles though.
ONLY tiles are allowed in there. No players. No buildings. Just "tiles". (Blocks if you want)

It was. Please refrain from using 32x32 tile textures.
our character is to fat to fit through the doors
Then make the buildings 32x32... Buildings do not belong in the tiles spreadsheet.

The real name is "The Fallen Empire". The theme is... Unknown.
