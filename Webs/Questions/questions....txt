Do you want the actors to be in bitmaps like this?

do you need magic/attack textures?

Can I make texture with a greater pixel density? ((like 32 or 64 pixels instead of 16?) for actors and characters?)

Are you at chads house? (I might be able to go over after soccer tonight, and again tommorow)

Chandler: I just made player.png, is it acceptable? (I gave it flippy Vampire hair) (I was also mimicking the one you liked)

Chandler: So... i'll be over a little after 8:00pm then???

Chandler: Have you been up all night?

Chandler: Nick Can I Ask A Question?

Nick: If you want to?

THAT ISN'T A QUESTION?

Can we add more tiles and possibly levels?
